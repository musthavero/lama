<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>I'm trying to make a marketplace laravel app.</p>
<p>I am new to the Laravel world, but am willing to learn on the way.</p>
<p>I want to build it as modular as possible, so changes can be made to each piece independent of the others.</p>

Required so far:

tailwind
alpine js
sortable js
nwidart laravel modules
livewire
